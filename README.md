<h3 align="left">Community context mediates effects of pollinator loss on seed production</h3>

  <p align="left">
A critical goal for ecologists is understanding how ongoing local and global species losses will affect ecosystem functions and services. Diversity-functioning relationships, which are well characterized in primary producer communities, are much less consistently predictable for ecosystem functions involving two or more trophic levels, particularly in situations where multiple species in one trophic level impact functional outcomes in a single target species at another trophic level. This is particularly relevant to pollination functioning, given ongoing pollinator declines and the value of understanding pollination functioning for single plant species like crops or threatened plants. We used spatially replicated, controlled single-pollinator-species removal experiments to assess how changes in bumble bee species richness impacted reproductive success in a perennial herb –– <em>Delphinium barbeyi</em> –– in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA. To improve predictability, we also assessed how the distribution of traits and abundances in the plant and bumble bee communities were related to <em>D. barbeyi</em> reproductive success. We hypothesized that trait-matching between pollinator proboscis length and <em>D. barbeyi</em>'s nectar spurs would lead to increased reproductive success, while morphological similarity within the floral community would dilute pollination services. Consistent with previous results in this system, we found that first, single-pollinator-species removals led to reduced reproductive output in <em>D. barbeyi</em>, and that this effect was not driven by changes in the abundance of pollinators. Second, the distribution of traits in the plant community influenced <em>D. barbeyi</em> reproduction, but in the opposite direction than what we expected (increased seed production in communities with greater floral similarity, suggesting a facilitative rather than competitive effect). Third, we observed a surprising reduction in reproductive output in the communities that we expected to experience high levels of trait-matching (high relative abundance of long-tongued bees). These results offer one example of the complex dynamics underlying ecosystem function in multi-trophic systems, and demonstrate that community context can impact diversity-functioning relationship between trophic levels with the loss of a single species.
